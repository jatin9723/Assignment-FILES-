        "=> Interpreted language is a type of programming language for which most of its\n",
        "implementation execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions.\n",
        "Compiled language is a programming language whose implementations are typically compilers which converts the source code to machine code.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#2 What is exception handling in python ?\n",
        "=> In python, an exception is an event that occurs during programme execution that distrupts the regular flow of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#3 What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling ?\n",
        "=> • The purpose of the finally block in exception handling is to write code that must be executed regardless of whether the try block generates an error.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#4 What is logging in python ?\n",
        "=> Logging in python is a crucial aspect of the coding process since it allows to keep track of everything that happens when run the code. Logging facilitates code monitoring, troubleshooting and debugging.\n",

        "\n",
        "#5 What is the significance of the _ _ del _ _ method in python ?\n",
        "=> The _ _ del _ _ method in python , also known as the destructor, is a special method that is called by the garbage collector when an object to be destroyed. Its primary significance lies in allowing an object to perform cleanup operations before it is removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#6 What is the difference between import and from ...import in python ?\n",
        "=> The import statement is used to import a module or a module's attribute into the current namespace whereas from ...import statement is used to import specific attributes from a module into the current namespace.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#7 How can you handle multiple exceptions in python ?\n",
        "=> We can handle multiple exceptions in python with a single exception block. In an except clause, we can use a tuple of values to define several exceptions.\n",

        "#9 What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing ?\n",
        "=> Multithreading - It is a technique where multiple threads are generated by a single process at the same time and implements concurrency. Multiprocessing - It is a technique where multiple processes run across multiple cores at the same time and implements parallelism.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#10 What are the advantages of using logging in a program ?\n",
        "=> The advantages of using logging in a program as it records the state and flow of program and shows how program behaves overtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#11 What is memory mangement in python ?\n",
        "=> Memory management in python is the process of allocating and dealing with memory so that the program can run efficiently. One advantage to python, compared to other programming languages, is that it can perform memory management tasks automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#12 What are the basics steps involved in exception handling in python ?\n",
        "=> The basics steps involved in exception handling in python are:\n",
        " 1.Use try and except block : To handle exceptions, we must utilise the try and exceptblocks. Define dangerous code that can throw an exception inside the try block and related handling code inside the except block.\n",
        " 2.Using try with finally : The finally block in python is used in conjucation with the try block statement. The finally block is used to write code that must be excecuted regardless of whether the try block generates an error.\n",
        " 3.Use try with else : Use the else statement in conjucation with try block. If want to run a specific code only if an exception is not produced.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#13 Why is memory management important in python ?\n",
        "=> Memory management important in python because it improves performance, scalability and reliability, even in a language that handles much of it automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#14 What is the role of try and except in exception handling ?\n",
        "=> The role of try and except in exception handling is to allow to catch and handle errors gracefully without crashing the program. The try block contains code that might raise an exception and the except block catches and handles the exception if one occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#15 How does python's garbage collection system work ?\n",
        "=> Python's garbag collection system work by automatically cleans up any unused objects based on reference counting and object allocation and deallocation. This also helps periodically clear up memory space to help a program run more smoothly.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#16 What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling ?\n",
        "=> The purpose of the else block in exception handling is to help when the code didn't enter the exception block. It separates the normal logic that should run only when everything goes well in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#17 What are the common logging levels in python ?\n",
        "=> The common logging levels in python are\n",
        " 1.DEBUG : To give detailed information of any variable, message while doing debugging.\n",
        " 2.INFO : This is used to convey that the code is working as expected.\n",
        " 3.WARNING : Used to indicate that something unexpected happened or potential issues in code.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#23 What are the challenges associated with memory management in python ?\n",
        "=> The challenges associated with memory management in python are:\n",
        " • Global Interpreter Lock ( GIL) Python(specifically CPython) uses a Global Interpreter Lock, which restricts execution to one thread at a time, even on multi-core processsors. This limits true parrallelism in memory-intensive, multi-threade applications.\n",
        " • Although Python has automatic garbage collection, memory leaks can still happen due to unintentional and circular references that the garbage collector does not clean up efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#24 How do you raise an exception manually in python ?\n",
        "=> We can raise an exception manually in python by using the raise statement. This is useful when you want to trigger an error intentionally, for example , to enforce a rule or validate input.\n",
